Did you know that you can grow plants hydroponically all year long?

With this project, you can start your own journey of sustainable farming.
The project is easy to set up and provides you with basic knowledge to grow locally sourced products indoors.

The role of the CanSat NeXT kit is to operate as a controller unit and provide an easy hardware and software platform to integrate the sensors and functionalities to.

### Features of the device created in this project

|  Feature  |       Description     |
|-----------|-----------------------|
|  LED illuminating unit  |  Built from botanical LEDs that are specifically designed for plant growth
|  Humidity sensor, temperature sensor     |  A sensor suite designed for monitoring growth conditions
|  Remote UI              |  A browser-based remote interface designed for monitoring sensor data and controlling illuminating units. The remote interface can be accessed with any network-capable device, such as a smartphone, tablet or PC, as long as the user is logged in to the same WiFi network as the CanSat device.
| LDR sensor |  A sensor which, based on the sensor data it provides, allows the product to be remotely controlled via a user interface to turn it on or off

*The selected LEDs are designed to produce blue and green light, chosen specifically for cultivation applications. Blue light enhances leaf growth and is crucial in the seeding phase and root development, while green light enhances light penetration into the deeper layers of the plant's leaves, which is beneficial in dense canopies. The LED technology featured in the project is engineered to replace traditional white LEDs in dual-channel (white + red) horticultural lighting systems. The result is a more energy-efficient solution when the goal of the system is to increase growth rather than blooming.*
