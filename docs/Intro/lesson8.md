# Lesson 8: Go with the Flow



This concludes the lessons for now. We will add more soon, but in the meanwhile you can find more information about using CanSat NeXT from the other Arduino examples, our [blog](./../../blog/) and the [software](./../CanSat-software/CanSat-software.md) and [hardware](./../CanSat-hardware/CanSat-hardware.md) documentation. I would love to hear your feedback and ideas regarding CanSat NeXT and these materials, so don't hesitate to contact me at samuli@kitsat.fi.
