# CanSat NeXT Accessories

We have developed several hardware modules for CanSat NeXT to expand the functionality of the kit. These include perf-board to create your own payload, GNSS module, as well as an external groundstation antenna for improved range and reliability in the radio link. These pages host the documentation for the hardware modules. 

If there is something you'd like more information about or have more questions about your progress (or find bugs in some libraries), don't hesitate to contact samuli@kitsat.fi to get help with your CanSat NeXT project.
