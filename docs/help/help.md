# Help Improve Translations

This site uses **machine translation** for non-English languages. While we've done our best to preserve accuracy and clarity, some mistakes or awkward phrasing may remain.

If you see something that doesn't make sense in your language - or if you'd like to help improve a whole section - we'd be very grateful.

## How You Can Help

You can contribute in several ways:

- 📝 **Report issues** directly via email: [support@kitsat.fi](mailto:support@kitsat.fi)
- 🌍 **Suggest better translations** by pointing out the English source and the improved local version
- 🔧 **Join the translation project** - contact us and we'll give you access to our translation files

## Technical Details

Translations are managed via the [Docusaurus i18n system](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/introduction) and generated using GPT-4. You can help by editing `.json` and `.md` translation files in GitHub or suggesting improved phrasing.
