This concludes the lessons for now. You can find more information about using CanSat NeXT from the other Arduino examples, our [blog](./../../blog/) and the [software](./../CanSat-software/CanSat-software.md) and [hardware](./../CanSat-hardware/CanSat-hardware.md) documentation. If you got this far, I would love to hear your feedback and ideas regarding CanSat NeXT and these materials, so don't hesitate to contact me at samuli@kitsat.fi.
